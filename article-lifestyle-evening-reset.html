      <p>
        Mornings often feel chaotic not because of the morning itself, but because of what we didn’t do the night before.
        The good news: you don’t need a huge nighttime routine. A simple 10-minute “reset” can remove a surprising amount
        of stress from tomorrow.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">Minute 1–3: Clear just one surface</h2>
      <p>
        Pick one “high traffic” spot — your desk, coffee table, or kitchen counter. For three minutes, clear it.
        Toss trash, stack papers, put dishes in the sink. Don’t organize the whole house. Just give your future self
        one clear place to start the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you wake up and see that clean area, it sends a quiet signal: <em>Today might go okay.</em>
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">Minute 4–6: Prep your tomorrow self a tiny bit</h2>
      <p>
        Ask, “What can I set up now so tomorrow is 10% easier?”
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lay out clothes.</li>
        <li>Put your bag, keys, and charger in one place.</li>
        <li>Fill the kettle or coffee maker.</li>
        <li>Put your water bottle where you’ll see it first thing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You’re not trying to script your whole day, just remove a few little frictions that normally slow you down.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">Minute 7–8: Pick your “one important thing”</h2>
      <p>
        Grab a small notepad or notes app and write:
      </p>
      <p><strong>“If I only get one useful thing done tomorrow, it will be…”</strong></p>
      <p>
        Then write that one thing. It could be a call you’ve been putting off, a work task, or even something personal
        like “finally book the dentist.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This doesn’t mean you’ll only do one thing — but it gives your day a clear anchor, so you’re less likely
        to get lost in random tasks.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">Minute 9–10: Slow your brain down</h2>
      <p>
        The last two minutes are for your mind, not your to-do list. Try one of these:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take 10 slow breaths while sitting on the edge of your bed.</li>
        <li>Write down three small things you’re grateful for from today.</li>
        <li>Read one page of a book instead of one more scroll.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You’re telling your brain: the day is closing; it’s okay to rest now.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">Tiny effort, big payoff</h2>
      <p>
        This 10-minute routine isn’t about perfection. Some nights you’ll do all of it; some nights you’ll just
        clear the table and write your “one important thing.” That’s still a win.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, these small resets stack up. Mornings feel less like a fire drill and more like a fresh start.
        And your future self will be very grateful for the 10 minutes you spent last night.
