      <p>
        When people hear “science,” they often imagine giant telescopes, white lab coats, and equations that look like secret codes.
        But most of the science that shapes your life is happening quietly in the background — on your skin, in your kitchen,
        and right outside your front door.

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">Your morning stretch is physics in action</h2>
      <p>
        When you wake up and stretch, you’re not just “getting the sleep out.” Your muscles and tendons are like tiny springs.
        While you slept, they rested in a shorter position. When you stretch, you’re gently pulling those springs back toward
        their full length, increasing blood flow and waking up nerve endings. That refreshed feeling? It’s your body rebooting
        its internal wiring.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">Why your coffee smells better than it tastes</h2>
      <p>
        Smell is actually a huge part of flavor. When you brew coffee, hot water releases hundreds of aromatic compounds.
        Many of them reach your nose before the cup even gets to your lips, telling your brain, “This is going to be good.”
        But some of those compounds are fragile and break down quickly, so the taste can feel milder than the smell.
        That’s why the first sniff of fresh coffee is often the best part.
      </p>

      <p>
        The same thing happens with fresh bread, cut oranges, and grilled food. You’re not just enjoying food — you’re
        experiencing chemistry in real time.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">The sky’s color is a light trick</h2>
      <p>
        On a clear day, the sky looks blue. At sunset, it turns orange and pink. Nothing about the air itself has changed —
        it’s still mostly nitrogen and oxygen. What changes is the angle of the sunlight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sunlight is made of many colors mixed together. When it passes through the atmosphere, tiny particles in the air scatter
        the shorter, bluer wavelengths more than the red ones. In the middle of the day, that scattered blue light dominates
        what you see.
      </p>
      <p>
        At sunrise and sunset, sunlight has to travel through more atmosphere because it’s coming in at a lower angle.
        The blue light gets scattered away before it reaches your eyes, leaving the warmer reds and oranges behind.
        Same star, same sky, different angle — instant artwork.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">The invisible city on your hands</h2>
      <p>
        Right now, millions of microscopic living things are on your skin. Before you panic: that’s normal,
        and most of them are either harmless or helpful. This community is called your <em>microbiome</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Different parts of your body have different “neighborhoods.” Your hands, face, and scalp each host their
        own mix of microbes. When you wash your hands, you’re not trying to remove every single microorganism —
        you’re trying to keep the population balanced so harmful ones don’t take over.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">Why this everyday science matters</h2>
      <p>
        Seeing the science in small moments does something important: it makes the world feel interesting again.
        You don’t have to read a textbook to enjoy it. You just need to ask simple questions:
        <em>Why does that happen? What’s going on behind the scenes?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The next time you watch steam rise from your tea, see a rainbow in a puddle, or feel your phone warm up
        in your hand, remember: you’re not just “existing” — you’re living inside one big, ongoing science experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you stay curious about the small stuff, the big stuff stops feeling so intimidating. And that might be
        the best science habit of all.
