        Your phone is an incredible tool. It can help you find your way in a new city, remember your grocery list,
        talk to someone across the world, or learn a new skill for free. But it can also quietly steal your time,
        attention, and even your mood — a few seconds at a time.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">The problem isn’t the phone — it’s the autopilot</h2>
      <p>
        Most of us don’t decide to spend an hour scrolling. We just pick up the phone “for a second,” and suddenly
        time disappears. The goal isn’t to throw your phone away. It’s to bring it back to being a tool you control,
        instead of a habit that controls you.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">1. Move your most distracting apps off the home screen</h2>
      <p>
        You don’t have to delete social media or games if you don’t want to. Start with something smaller:
        move those apps off your first screen and into a folder. Your brain is very sensitive to convenience —
        if the app is right in front of you, you’ll tap it without thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        The extra step of opening a folder is just enough friction to make you ask,
        “Do I really want to go there right now?”
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">2. Turn off non-human notifications</h2>
      <p>
        Not every app deserves the power to interrupt you. A simple rule:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>If it’s not a real person trying to reach you, it probably doesn’t need to buzz.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Turn off notifications for sales, likes, “updates,” and random alerts. Keep only what truly matters:
        calls, messages from close people, maybe calendar reminders. Suddenly, your phone will feel much quieter,
        and your brain will too.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">3. Decide what your phone is “for” today</h2>
      <p>
        Before you unlock your phone, ask one quick question:
        <em>What do I want to use this for right now?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe it’s checking a message, looking up a recipe, or setting a timer. Say it to yourself:
        “I’m opening my phone to do X.” After you’re done, lock it again. This tiny habit pulls you out of
        autopilot and back into intention.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">4. Create one “screen-free” zone</h2>
      <p>
        Pick one part of your day where your phone doesn’t follow you. It might be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>First 20 minutes after you wake up</li>
        <li>During meals</li>
        <li>The hour before bed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That small daily break gives your mind a chance to reset, and it makes the rest of your screen time
        feel less foggy and more in your control.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">5. Use your phone to build your offline life</h2>
      <p>
        Your phone can actually help you get away from your phone:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use it to schedule walks, workouts, or meetups.</li>
        <li>Use notes or reminders to support your goals, not distract from them.</li>
        <li>Use timers to limit how long you want to spend on a certain app.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When your phone helps you do more in the real world, it stops feeling like a trap and starts feeling
        like the tool it was supposed to be.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">Small changes, big difference</h2>
      <p>
        You don’t have to be perfect or go offline completely. Even one or two of these changes can bring back
        hours of attention you didn’t realize you were losing. In the end, the question isn’t
        “Is technology good or bad?” It’s:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Is this helping me live the kind of day I actually want?</strong></p>
      <p>
        When the answer starts being “yes” more often, you’ll know you’re the one using your phone — not the other way around.
