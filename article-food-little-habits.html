      <p>
        You don’t need a complicated diet, a fancy blender, or a color-coded meal plan to eat better.
        For most people, what changes the day isn’t perfection — it’s a few tiny habits that are easy
        enough to repeat, even on busy days.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">1. Start the day with a glass of water, not a decision</h2>
      <p>
        Mornings are full of choices: what to wear, what to answer first, what to eat. One easy win is to remove
        one of those decisions. Before coffee, tea, or scrolling, drink a glass of water.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wakes up your system, helps your body recover from a night without fluids, and sets a simple tone:
        you did one healthy thing before the day even started.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">2. Make one “default” breakfast</h2>
      <p>
        Pick one breakfast that’s:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Easy to make in under 5–7 minutes</li>
        <li>Filling enough to last a few hours</li>
        <li>Something you actually enjoy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It could be yogurt with fruit, eggs and toast, oatmeal, or a simple smoothie. The goal isn’t variety;
        it’s having a fallback meal you can make almost on autopilot. When life is busy, that default breakfast
        keeps you from skipping food or reaching for something that leaves you hungry again in an hour.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">3. Add, don’t just remove</h2>
      <p>
        Most “healthy eating” advice focuses on what you should stop eating. That gets tiring fast. A gentler approach:
        ask, <em>what can I add?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Add a handful of veggies to your dinner. Add fruit to your snack. Add a bit more protein to your lunch.
        Adding good things naturally pushes some of the less helpful stuff to the edges without turning every meal
        into a rulebook.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">4. Make one snack a “real food” snack</h2>
      <p>
        Snacks are where a lot of people feel out of control — you’re tired, rushed, or stressed, and your hand jumps
        to the easiest thing nearby. Instead of trying to overhaul everything, make a tiny rule:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Once a day, I’ll choose a snack that looks like actual food.</strong></p>
      <p>
        That can mean an apple, nuts, a boiled egg, cheese and crackers, hummus with veggies — anything closer to its
        real form than to a shiny wrapper. Over time, those “real food” snacks add up in how you feel.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">5. End the day with something warm and simple</h2>
      <p>
        Evenings are when mindless eating often shows up — especially in front of a screen. One small ritual that
        helps is finishing the day with something warm and light: herbal tea, warm milk, or a simple broth.
      </p>
      <p>
        It gives your body and brain a clear signal: the eating part of the day is winding down. No guilt, no drama,
        just a gentle closing scene.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">Food as a daily comfort, not a daily battle</h2>
      <p>
        You don’t need to chase the “perfect” way of eating. Start with one or two of these habits, and let them
        become part of your normal routine. When food feels simple and supportive instead of stressful, the rest
        of your day gets easier too.
