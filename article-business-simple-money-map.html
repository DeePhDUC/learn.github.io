        Money can feel complicated quickly: budgets, spreadsheets, apps, advice from a hundred places.
        But most people don’t need a perfect system. They need a simple way to look at their money that
        makes sense and is easy to repeat every month.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">Think in three buckets, not fifty categories</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of trying to track every tiny line item, imagine your monthly money in just three buckets:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Must Live</strong> – rent, food, basic bills, transport</li>
        <li><strong>Must Grow</strong> – savings, investments, debt payments</li>
        <li><strong>Must Enjoy</strong> – fun, treats, little upgrades that make life brighter</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Every dollar you earn falls into one of these three. That’s it. Simple enough to remember,
        clear enough to guide decisions.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">1. Must Live: your foundation</h2>
      <p>
        This bucket covers the basics that keep your life running: a roof, light, internet,
        groceries, essential transport, phone. It’s not everything you <em>want</em>, just what you truly need.
      </p>
      <p>
        A helpful question: <em>Is this something my life actually can’t function without this month?</em>
        If yes, it goes here. If no, it’s probably in Enjoy.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">2. Must Grow: your future</h2>
      <p>
        This is the bucket many people skip, not because they don’t care, but because the month runs out
        before they get to it. Flip that around: try to pay your future self first.
      </p>
      <p>
        This bucket includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Savings for emergencies</li>
        <li>Paying down debt</li>
        <li>Investing for the long term</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even a small, consistent amount matters. If all you can do this month is a little,
        do a little. It signals that your future you matters as much as your present you.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">3. Must Enjoy: your daily joy</h2>
      <p>
        This bucket keeps your life from feeling like a spreadsheet. Coffee with a friend, streaming services,
        hobbies, small gifts, takeout, a nicer version of something you already use — they all go here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trick is to give this bucket a real, honest amount — not zero, not everything.
        When you give yourself a little room to enjoy your money, it’s easier to stick to your “Live” and “Grow” plans.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">One 10-minute check-in per month</h2>
      <p>
        Once a month, sit down with your numbers and ask:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How much came in?</li>
        <li>Roughly how much went to each bucket?</li>
        <li>Do I want to shift anything next month?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You don’t have to be exact down to the penny. The goal is awareness and small adjustments:
        maybe a little less on Enjoy next month so Grow gets a boost, or maybe you realize Live costs
        are creeping up and you look for one bill to renegotiate.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">Make money a conversation, not a secret</h2>
      <p>
        If you share money decisions with a partner or family, try using the three buckets as a simple language:
        “Can we move a bit from Enjoy to Grow this month?” or “Our Live bucket is getting big — where can we trim?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Money always feels scarier in the dark. A simple, honest framework turns it into something you can actually talk about.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t have to be a finance expert to take control. You just have to see your money clearly enough to make a few
        better choices each month. The three buckets are one way to start.
